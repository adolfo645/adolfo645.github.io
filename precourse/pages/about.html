            <h2>Why am I interested in coding?</h2>
            <p>
                I have always been a curious person. As a child I used to break and disamble anything I found at home.
                My mom would get mad at me because I would open VHS cassettes just to understand how were they made on
                the inside. So, my interest on things and how they work is very related to the programming field, as it
                is what it allows us to use the everyday tools we could not live without. I even like reading astronomy
                books because I love to understand how our universe works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before studying my career I was actually interested on taking a journey on software engineering and
                development, but some circumstances, including the starting dates from the university I was accepted in,
                made me end up studying Business Management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I am in Israel and that ITC has offered such a great opportunity I did not want to let it go by
                without taking it, as I can now start studying a subject I have always been interested in, and in
                Israel! With all the implications that means regarding the tech world.

                <h2>Cities related to me</h2>
                <p>I was born in Colombia, in a small city called Pereira. The weather there is amazing, as normally it goes around 20 to 23 degrees celsius all year long, and there is great coffee too!.</p>
                <p>Throughout my life I have had the opportunity of visiting different countries and places, but my favorite ones have to be:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heidlerberg, Germany.</li>
                        <li>Haifa, Israel.</li>
                        <li>Cartagena, Colombia.</li>
